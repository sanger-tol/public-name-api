# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was initially generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. 
You can easily generate a server stub by using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server.  

This application uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Setup
- First create a local Python virtual enviroment
```
python2 -m venv venv
```

- Activate the Python virtual enviroment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Read and run the pre-reqs in setup.py
```
python setup.py install
```

- Install all required Python libraries
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Install connexion with extra install: 
```
pip install 'connexion[swagger-ui]'
```


## Usage
To run the server, run "start.sh" or alternatively execute the following from the root directory:
```
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:
```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

You can directly test the server:
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/public-name?searchString=9606" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

The Swagger definition lives here:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Rebuild the local sqlite3 database
The database is rebuilt from scratch each time you use the "start.sh" script. 
You can alternatively run the script "reset_database.sh"

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
