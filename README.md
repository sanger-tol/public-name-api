# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was initially generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  

This application uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Setup
- First read and run the pre-reqs in setup.py
- Please install connexion with extra install: "pip install 'connexion[swagger-ui]'"
or provide the path to your local installation by passing swagger_path=YOUR_PATH

## Usage
To run the server, run "start.sh" or alternatively execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```
You can directly test the server:
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/public-name?searchString=9606" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

The Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Rebuild the local sqlite3 database
- run the script "reset_database.sh"
```
mv public_names.db public_names.db.old
mv final_merged.txt final_merged.txt.old
curl -s https://gitlab.com/wtsi-grit/darwin-tree-of-life-sample-naming/-/raw/master/final_merged.txt -o final_merged.txt
nohup start.sh &
echo $! > save_pid.txt
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/public-name?searchString=force_database_rebuild" -H  "accept: application/json"
kill -9 `cat save_pid.txt`
rm save_pid.txt
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
